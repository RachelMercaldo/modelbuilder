\title{Create a rxode simulation model}
\usage{
generate_rxode(model, location = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{model structure, either as list object or Rdata file name}

\item{location}{a path/folder to save the simulation code to. Default is current directory}
}
\value{
The function does not return anything
Instead, it writes an R file into the specified directory
the name of the file is simulate_model$title_rxode.R
}
\description{
The model needs to adhere to the structure specified by the modelbuilder package
models built using the modelbuilder package automatically have the right structure
a user can also build a model list structure themselves following the specifications
if the user provides an Rdata file name, this file needs to contain an object called 'model'
and contain a valid modelbuilder model structure
